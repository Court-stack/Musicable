			<div>
				<h2 style ="color: #FFFFFF">What is your interest in IT:</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I'm studying IT in order to change career paths. 
				I've always had an interest in computers and modern technology but had never really pursued it. 
				I have no educational or professional background in IT except for short time in high school 
				where I had learnt some basic HTML. I'm really excited to see where technology takes us in the 
				future and how it will continue to evolve. Particularly in terms of Virtual Reality.</p>

				<h2 style ="color: #FFFFFF">Why did you choose to come to RMIT:</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I chose RMIT because it always seemed like such a prestigious university. 
				I would see the campus whenever I travelled to Melbourne and would think to myself “I’d love to be 
				a student there.” I had to decide on where I wanted to study IT, the only local university is the 
				University of Tasmania which isn’t a bad university, but it certainly isn’t the best around. 
				So, I made a choice to study online instead and saw that RMIT did online classes, this lead me to 
				applying for the foundational courses here.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 style ="color: #FFFFFF">What do you expect to learn from your studies:</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">How to present myself and my ideas in a professional way suitable for a 
				career related to the IT field.</p>

				<h2 style ="color: #FFFFFF">Ideal job:</h2>
				<h3 style="color: #FFFFFF"><a href="https://procreate.art/careers/software-engineer">
				Software Engineer at Procreate</a></h3><br>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">This job is ideal because it is most likely the only local company that does software development. 
				I would not have to relocate and it is a career that I am interested in. This job exists to develop 
				and optimize the procreate application on iOS.<br><br>
				For this job, knowledge of a programming language, C (or something similar) is required. They don’t 
				require qualifications, but simply an example that shows you are capable of working for them.<br><br>
				I have the enthusiasm for this company to work for them, they develop an application that I am quite 
				interested in. I currently lack the expertise. Firstly, I would need to learn C. Secondly I should 
				attempt to develop something to show my ability to work in the language.<br><br>
				I am hoping to work through to Bachelor to Information Technology course at RMIT to develop my ability 
				to program to a degree where applying and succesfully attaining a job here is possible.</p></br>
