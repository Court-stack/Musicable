				<h1 style="font-size: 700%;color: #FFFFFF">Project idea: Musicable</h1>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF">Overview</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">A simple tablet application that hosts sheet music for musicians. 
				As a musician is playing through music, the application will progress through the music 
				thus limiting the need for the musician to interact with the sheet music physically. This 
				allows sheet music that may otherwise be hard to play while fiddling with pages of paper to 
				become a much more pleasant experience on the part of the musician. This also acts as a 
				library, or a one-stop shop where a musician’s sheet music can be stored. Furthermore, it can 
				potentially implement a store-front where musicians can browse and buy sheet music they 
				would like to play.</p>
			</div>

				<img style="float:left" src="band.jpg">
				<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF">Motivation</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">When practicing or performing a song, nothing can be more stressful 
				than pages that stick together or refuse to sit neatly against a stand. They can be ripped, 
				covered in scribbles or damaged by water. This isn’t just a problem for one person either. 
				According to an examination and accreditation board of music based in the United Kingdom, 
				ABRSM, approximately 34% or 17.2 million adults currently play musical instruments in the UK. 
				On top of this a further 40% or 20.2 million adults have previously played musical instruments 
				in the past. This does not even count the 69% of children in the United Kingdom who currently 
				play a musical instrumental of some kind. There is a market of over 20 million people in the 
				UK alone who could benefit from such an application.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF">Description</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">It’s a simple free app that anyone can download onto their tablet or 
				phone. Users can upload photos or photocopies of sheet music they have to their own private 
				library in the application – these personal uploads cannot be shared publicly. Users can choose 
				to store these pieces in their personal collection in a variety of ways. The music can be stored 
				in folders allocated to genre, composer, theme, instrument, or can be put into customised 
				folders. This means if the user plays in a variety of bands and ensembles, they can create custom 
				folders to put specific music in. The user can also add a description to each individual page 
				containing pertinent information, such as:<br><br>
				•	“This song will be played at a concert on Sat, 11th July at 4 o’ clock at the Stanley Burbury 
				Theatre. Bump in is at 10 am.”<br><br>
				•	“There are recordings to this piece here, here and here”<br><br>
				•	“This song was written for Saxophone, but it will be played on Tenor Horn for the gig.”<br><br>
				Users can then add practice markings to the sheet music. The app will allow users to place notes 
				and makings where needed if they need to remember something. This will act in a similar way to 
				Sibelius’s notation feature where users can drag and drop markings where needed. As well as this, 
				the app will allow for handwritten notes when needed.<br><br>
				There are several ways users could potentially advance through the pages of music while performing. 
				The simplest way is if the user taps or swipes the screen, however this may not always be possible. 
				Alternatives to this method could be allowing users to use a pedal to swap pages. Some companies 
				already do this, but it would allow for ease of access if we could make a simple version ourselves. 
				When tapping the pedal, it will send a signal to the tablet, telling it to go to the next page. A 
				third alternative, although this may take time to develop, is for the application to analyse 
				submitted music and listen to what the user is playing. Once it hears that the user has reached the 
				end of the page, the application will then automatically turn to the next. A final alternative would 
				be to include a metronome in the application that keeps count of time. This means a user can play along 
				with the metronome and once enough bars have been counted, it will then proceed to the next page.<br><br>
				The application will also have a store where people can buy sheet music they can play. For solos it will 
				come with the sheet music required for accompaniment. Music purchased through the in-app store will 
				have all the same benefits as user uploaded music but with some perks on top. Namely, since the sheet 
				music will be added by us, we can have it fully integrated with the application. Meaning we won’t be 
				relying on the application’s ability to scan and understand what is happening on the music, we can tell 
				it what exactly is happening. This means it will be more accurately understand where the user is playing 
				in relation to the music and will be able to turn the page at a more precise moment. Another feature our 
				in-store purchases could have is the ability to play the accompaniment of music the user is performing. 
				This will allow for a greater understanding of the entire piece from the perspective of the musician. 
				The accompaniment for more popular pieces can be recordings of people performing the piece as opposed 
				to more generic MIDI versions.<br><br>
				Another feature our application could include is a kind of forum for musicians. A simple discussion 
				board where users can discuss songs they are playing as well as give advice on how to play the song 
				in a musical manner. This way it can create a strong online community for budding musicians, where 
				they can collaborate their ideas and improve themselves.</p>

				<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF">Tools and Technologies</h2>
				<img style="float:right" src="band2.jpg">
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">The software for the groundwork to save and display images is relatively 
				simple. Some difficulties may arise when we require the tablet to identify tone and pitch.  Several 
				algorithms do already exist that can understand and analyse pitch, such as YAAPT (Yet Another Algorithm 
				for Pitch Tracking), developed by Dr. Stephen A. Zahorian.<br><br>
				Another issue that can potentially arise is the ability for our software to be analyse written music 
				notation. As documented in the article, “Optical music recognition: state-of-the-art and open issues”, 
				there are many algorithms that are capable of reading and understanding music. <br><br>
				Finally, it was also suggested that a pedal could be produced to aid people in page turning. The 
				manufacturing of such a device would be fairly simple. The tablet only needs to be able to detect when 
				the pedal is pressed and does not need to differentiate different signals.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF">Skills Required</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">This application would require a programmer with knowledge of the programming 
				language “Swift”. This would enable us to create the application specifically for iOS. Also, someone with 
				experience with iOS apps would be able to guide us on how to develop an app specifically for the Apple store. 
				Ideally to develop the application for Android devices, we would also require someone with knowledge of Java,
				basic or Kotlin. Also, if we do pursue developing hardware for this application, we would require an engineer 
				to create the device, or to outsource to a third party who already makes pedals to produce such devices for 
				our application. This would also make it significantly easier to work out the kinks if we use pre-existing 
				technology.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 style="color: #FFFFFF">Outcome</h2>
				<p style="color: #FFFFFF">The primary use of this application is to create a method for musicians to easily 
				be able to read and flip through music without the need of dealing with physical pages. Even if the program 
				does not because a widespread success it will have still fulfilled its base purpose. However, if this 
				application does see a large scale of success among amateur and professional musicians it could potentially 
				outgrow initial expectations. This application could not only see utilization in the home, but also in 
				professional bands and ensembles, in community bands and in a classroom setting. This could create a worldwide 
				community of musicians that has not previously existed.</p>
