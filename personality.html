					<h3 style="color: #FFFFFF">What do you think the results of these tests mean for you:</h3>
					<p style="color: #FFFFFF">It gives me a clearer idea of my learning style and how I conduct 
					myself in a professional setting. I can also see my faults and how to improve upon myself 
					in order to become a more reliable worker.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 style="color: #FFFFFF">How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?:</h3>
					<p style="color: #FFFFFF">They have made clear to me that at times I can be abrasive when I disagree 
					with how someone is doing a task. I am more aware of this now. In the future, for all group related 
					work, I shall strive to relax and not get caught up in the minute details of how everyone is working.  
					I will focus more on my own work and only help ensure that other members of the group will meet 
					their deadlines.</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 style="color: #FFFFFF">How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
					<p style="color: #FFFFFF">I believe I should endeavour to find people who balance my weak points. 
					By having a diverse group of people at different skill levels, we can work efficiently support each 
					otherâ€™s strengths to create a high quality project outcome in a timely manner.</p>
